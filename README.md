# TP5: HTTP Requests

## 📝 Goal

The goal is to link the app to a Rest API using [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/):

You can either use:
 - your own Book Rest API
 - a generic one accessible on: https://bookshelf-gme.cleverapps.io/books

Preparatory work:
- Copy everything from previous TP (except the README)

First:
- Add retrofit dependencies (see course slides) to `build.gradle`
- Add internet permission in `AndroidManifest`

Then:
- Create a `BookService` interface
- Add a `getAllBooks` function with annotations matching the API
- Create an instance of `retrofit` and instantiate `BookService` with it in `MainActivity`
- Call `getAllBooks` in the `onCreate` function and display the books returned by the server

- Add a `createBook` function with annotations matching the API
- Call `createBook` to post a new book to the server and then display the list of books (including the freshly created one)

Finally:
- Add some Toasts to properly display and handle network errors

## 🚀 Getting Started

 - Start Android Studio
 - Select `Open an existing Android Studio project` and pick this directory

That's it! You can code!
